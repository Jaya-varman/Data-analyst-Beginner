🌡️ Temperature Change Analysis in India (Monthly & Yearly Trends)

📁 Project Overview
This project analyzes temperature change trends in India over the years, focusing on monthly and annual averages.
The goal is to identify long-term warming patterns, seasonal shifts, and unusually hot or cold years using historical climate data.


 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize average monthly and annual temperatures over time.
- Identify which months are warming fastest.
- Detect unusually hot or cold years.
- Compare seasonal temperature trends (e.g., summer vs. winter).
- Generate insights to support awareness of climate change in India.



 📊 Dataset
  - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india
  - Columns:
  - `Year`: Year of observation.
  - `Jan` to `Dec`: Monthly average temperatures.
  - `Annual`: Annual average temperature.



 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy (for trendline analysis)



 📈 Key Features & Analysis
- Line plots for individual months across years.
- Combined graphs comparing multiple months.
- Heatmaps for seasonal and annual trends.
- Linear regression to identify fastest warming months.
- Subplots for clear month-by-month comparisons.



📌 Insights
- 📅 Fastest Warming Months: FEB,MAR,DEC
- 🔥 Hottest Year:2016 — 31.63°C
- ❄️ Coldest Year:1917 — 28.11°C
- 🔁 Seasonal Shift:
        - Winter warming rate: 0.0181 °C/YEAR
        - Summer warming rate: 0.0099 °C/YEAR
        → Winters are warming faster than summers.
